Angular has view encapsulation i.e. shadow DOM... It has unique attributes by angular to specific elements. Style encapsulation

Once it changes style selector, it adds attribute selector to styles defined for the component

We can apply diff styles for each element in shadow DOM




Using ViewEncapsulation, we can add remove attributes from component




Local reference can be used in template only



<ng-content></ng-content> acts as a hook in our component to mark a place for angular 
where it should place any component between opening and closing tag. Anything between 
ng-content tags will be projected into your component. Feature to build reusable widgets
